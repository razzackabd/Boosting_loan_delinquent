# Boosting_loan_delinquent
Loan Delinquency Prediction Using Boosting Algorithms (LA Loan Dataset)

📖 Project Description

This project focuses on predicting loan delinquency using Boosting-based machine learning algorithms on the LA Loan Dataset.
Boosting techniques improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple weak learners into a strong model, making them highly effective for classification problems such as loan default prediction.

The model classifies borrowers as delinquent or non-delinquent based on financial, credit, and demographic attributes.
